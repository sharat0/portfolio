                    January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Prior to this, the various
                    computer networks did
                    not have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was
                    established called Transfer

                <p>In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University,
                    when they created a
                    website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web". The site was a directory of
                    other websites,
                    organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and
                    David's Guide to the
                    World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!". The human-edited Yahoo! Directory, provided for users
                    to surf through the
                    Internet, became their first product and the company's original purpose. The "yahoo.com"
                    domain was created on
                    January 18, 1995.

                <p>Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related
                    services and products,
                    which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and
                    hardware. It is
                    considered one of the Big Five technology companies in the U.S. information technology industry,
                    alongside Amazon,
                    Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft.
                    <br>
                    Google was founded on September 4th, 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D.
                    students at
                    Stanford University
                    in California. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the
                    stockholder voting power
                    through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a California privately held company on
                    September 4, 1998, in
                    California. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002. An initial public
                    offering (IPO) took
                    place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California,
                    nicknamed the Googleplex.
                    In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called
                    Alphabet Inc. Google
                    is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's
                    Internet interests. Sundar
                    Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet.

                    YouTube was founded by
                    Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, who were all early employees of PayPal. Hurley had
                    studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer
                    science together at the
                    University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign

                    Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson's role in 2004 Super Bowl
                    incident when her breast
                    was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Karim could
                    not easily find video
                    clips of either event online, which led to the idea of a video sharing site. Hurley and Chen
                    said that the original
                    idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service, and had been influenced by the
                    website Hot or
                    Not. They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of
                    themselves to YouTube in
                    exchange for a $100 reward. Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of
                    plans, with the site's
                    founders deciding to accept uploads of any type of video.

                    Twitter's origins lie in a "daylong brainstorming session" held by board members of the
                    podcasting company Odeo. Jack
                    Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an
                    individual using an SMS service
                    to communicate with a small group. The original project code name for the service was
                    twttr, an idea that
                    Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass, inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of
                    American SMS short codes.
                    The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and
                    it was six months after
                    the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to
                    Twitter. The
                    developers initially considered "10958" as a short code, but later changed it to "40404" for
                    "ease of use and
                    memorability". Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the
                    first Twitter message at
                    9:50 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST): "just setting up my twttr". Dorsey has explained the
                    origin of the "Twitter"
                    title:

                    ...we came across the word 'twitter', and it was just perfect. The definition was 'a short burst
                    of inconsequential
                    information,' and 'chirps from birds'. And that's exactly what the product was.

                    WhatsApp was founded in by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, former employees of Yahoo!. <br> </p>

                <p>In January 2009, after purchasing an iPhone and realizing the potential of the app industry on
                    the App Store, Koum and
                    Acton began visiting Koum's friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose to discuss a new type of
                    messaging app that would "show
                    statuses next to individual names of the people".[citation needed] They realized that to take
                    the idea further, they
                    would need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor
                    Solomennikov, and
                    introduced him to Koum. <br>

                    Koum named the app WhatsApp to sound like "what's up". On February 16, 2009, he incorporated
                    WhatsApp Inc. in
                    California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving up
                    and looking for a new job.
                    Acton encouraged him to wait for a "few more months". <br>
                    Later in 2014, the CEO of Facebook Mark Zucker bought Whatsapp for $19bn.

                    Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG or Insta) is an American photo and video sharing social
                    networking service
                    owned by Facebook, created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and originally launched on iOS in
                    October 2010. The Android
                    version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November
                    2012, a Fire OS app in
                    June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. The app allows users to upload media that
                    can be edited with
                    filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with
                    pre-approved followers.
                    Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can
                    like photos and follow
                    other users to add their content to a feed, a function that seems to be discontinued as of
                    September 2020. <br>

                    Instagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1)
                    aspect ratio with 640
                    pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, these restrictions were
                    eased with an increase to

                    or videos in a single
                    post, and a Stories featureâ€”similar to its main opposition Snapchatâ€”which allows users to post
                    photos and videos to a
                    sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the
                    Stories feature is used
                    by 500 million users daily.
